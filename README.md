## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: I can't trigger a workflow like `/intro`**  
A: You may be in "Ask" mode instead of "Code" mode. Workflows can only be triggered in Code mode. Click the mode selector button at the bottom left of the Cascade input box and select "Code" mode, then try again.

**Q: I see "Model provider unreachable" error in Cascade**  
A: Close Windsurf completely and reopen it. You should be able to pick up where you left off in your training.
